Evan Amason's CS121 Instagram Tutorial Project

This project is an Instagram-like website created by following the instruction in this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpFO4Zr0EPE. On this project, I received help from Jake Palanker and Sara McAllister when working through bugs.

The website allows users to register, login, log out, post pictures with descriptions, and view all posted pictures.

Below, we see the site's registration page, where new users can make an account.

Now, we can see the site's login page, where returning users can log back in.

Finally, below we can see the page where users can create a new post by uploading a picture and writing a description.
