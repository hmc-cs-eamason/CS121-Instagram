Evan Amason's CS121 Instagram Tutorial Project

This project is an Instagram-like website created by following the instruction in this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpFO4Zr0EPE.

The website allows users to register, login, log out, post pictures with descriptions, and view all posted pictures.

Below, we see the site's registration page, where new users can make an account.
